These are the first programs I wrote when I was first learning C, around 15 years of age. 

These are typed up from my notebooks of the time, where I had painstakingly copied down every line of code from the computers (which turned out a good idea, because the training center's computers crashed and lost all the code!). 

They are typed as they are in the notebooks, with no changes whatsoever, ever when they contain bad programming practices (which they certainly do). This is meant as a historical record, not as a "how to program" guide. 

The order in which the programs are written in the notebook (which might be helpful to see if/how I progressed with time) is below:

1. prime.c
2.
